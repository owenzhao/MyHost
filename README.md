# My Host

My Host gets the MACs, and IP addresses of a Mac. It also gets IP addresses of the internet. Besides, My Host could alert those value changes in every 5 seconds.

## Install by SPM
Using in Swift Package Manger, just search with "https://github.com/owenzhao/MyHost.git" and version 1.0.18.

## How to Use
Just see the sample app [My IP](https://github.com/owenzhao/My-IP).

## Why Use My Host
There are other framewoks that can get internet ip. However, I had tried the top three of them on github, they all had issues. The issue was when the internet ip changed, they still provide the old ip, not the new one. So I wrote the code myself.

Here is [why they have the issue](https://zhaoxin.pro/16465230198548.html).
